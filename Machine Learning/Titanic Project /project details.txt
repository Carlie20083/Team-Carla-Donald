This was an exercise that I did in machine learning. The best part of this tutorial was it got me to 
submit my result on Kaggle, which I have to say was a bit scary. Since stating my Data Science program I really 
hadn't felt I was ready to use Kraggle. but exploring the site and doing this exercise, I have to say it was fun.
